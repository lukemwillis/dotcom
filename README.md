## Debugging

Windows users might encounter `node-gyp` errors when trying to npm install.
To resolve, make sure that you have both Python 2.7 and the Visual C++ build environment installed. Then run:

```
npm config set python C:\Python27\python.exe
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
