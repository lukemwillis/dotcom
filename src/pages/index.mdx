# Are you stuck at home staring at a screen?

Ask yourself:

- How many times have you rewatched The Office?
- Do you really want to join that social Zoom call this evening?
- Have you been scrolling through Netflix hoping for something new?
- Is your sleep quality getting worse?
- Are you looking for a new hobby that won't cost you a penny?

I've got news for you:

There's a whole world of entertaining and fulfilling content waiting to be discovered.

**You need a book.** ðŸ“–

Maybe you're already an avid reader who's struggling to find the time now that your commute disappeared. Or perhaps you've been meaning to pick up a book for years but haven't found the time. Possibly, your local library closing has prevented you from jumping in.

Whatever your reason, you probably only need a slight push to pick up a book.

## How about free book giveaways every weekday?

Here's how it will work:

1. Join the waitlist below
2. Let me know what books you want
3. Invite your friends (no judgment if you want to keep this to yourself, but more people signing up means more books)
4. When we reach critical mass, you'll receive an email announcing the first giveaway

## Make free books a reality and help decide which books will drop first!

## FAQ

### What's the catch?

This all depends on sponsorships. If you know any new authors, small publishers, apps for readers, etc. that want to grow their readership/userbase/etc., let me know. I want to help introduce readers to the many excellent books that don't have huge marketing budgets behind them. I'll still be giving away highly popular titles, but this won't be any fun if we can't support new authors.

### What does "critical mass" mean? Will this ever actually be a reality?

Critical mass means 100 engaged readers on the waitlist. What does "engaged" mean? It means you respond to my email when I ask for your input. Simple as that.

Once there's enough interest, the giveaways will move to a new website (e.g. signuptowinfreebookseveryweekday.com... Ok, probably something snappier). You'll get an email to confirm you're still interested. Then the giveaways will begin shortly.

### Who even is Luke Willis?

I'm just another reader in the Seattle area. I've recently been listening to a lot of Audiobooks, but I prefer real paper books to any other format. The library is fantastic (when it's open), but I love owning the books I read. It gives me the freedom to mark up the pages (which I rarely do), revisit the books I loved, and loan out or give away the books I think others would appreciate.
